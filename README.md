# AI Learning and Development

Welcome to my GitHub repository! This space is dedicated to my journey in learning and developing Artificial Intelligence (AI) projects. I will explore various concepts and techniques, starting from basic Machine Learning to more advanced topics like generative AI, supervised and unsupervised learning, and working with popular AI tools.

## Goals

1. **Machine Learning Basics**:  
   Learning the fundamentals of Machine Learning, including algorithms like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines.
   
2. **Supervised and Unsupervised Learning**:  
   Diving into supervised learning models (e.g., classification, regression) and unsupervised learning models (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction).

3. **Generative AI**:  
   Exploring AI techniques that can create new data, images, or text, with a focus on models such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and transformers.

## Tools and Libraries

Throughout this journey, I will be working with the following tools and frameworks:

- **PyTorch**: For building and training deep learning models.
- **TensorFlow**: Another powerful tool for AI and machine learning development.
- **scikit-learn**: For classical machine learning algorithms.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: For data manipulation and analysis.

## Projects

- **Project 0**: [Learning about Pytorch] - A basic project to learn more about PyTorch before starting our studies.
- **Project 1**: [Introduction to Machine Learning] - A project focused on understanding the basics of ML algorithms and datasets.
- **Project 2**: [Supervised Learning] - Implementing supervised learning techniques using PyTorch and scikit-learn.
- **Project 3**: [Generative AI with GANs] - Building a simple Generative Adversarial Network to create new images.

More projects will be added as I progress in my learning.

## Future Plans

- **Advanced AI Techniques**: After completing the basics, I plan to dive deeper into AI with Reinforcement Learning, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Computer Vision.
- **Collaboration**: I am open to collaborating with others who are interested in AI, so feel free to reach out!
